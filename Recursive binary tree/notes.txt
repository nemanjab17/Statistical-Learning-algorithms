currently, sum of squares is calculated using brute forse, gradient descent should be added.
Also in some cases, it is not dividing predictor space when it should, if you have any ideas how i should fix it,

Using the data from the book: An introduction to Statistical Learning -  James, Tibshirani 

P.S. sorry about the Serbian comments in the script, sometimes when the thinking process is hard for me,
it is easier if i use Serbian to guide myself through.
